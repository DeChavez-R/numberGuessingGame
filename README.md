# Number Guessing Game (C++)

A simple console-based number guessing game written in C++.
This is my first GitHub repository and a learning project.

## Features
- Random number generation (1–100)
- Input validation
- Limited number of attempts
- Replay option
- Clean, readable C++ code

## How to Build and Run

### Using g++
```bash
g++ main.cpp -o guessing_game
./guessing_game

## Requirements
C++11 or later
g++ / clang++
## What I Learned
Input validation in C++
Control flow and loops
Functions and code organization
Basic random number usage
## Future Improvements
Difficulty levels
Score tracking
Modern C++ random (<random>)
Refactor into classes
